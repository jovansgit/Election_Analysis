# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: 
The purpose of this project is to provide election analysis needed by the Colorado Board of Elections.
In this project, our final Python script will deliver the following information: 

* Total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* Total number of votes each candidate received
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

### Election-Audit Results

* There were 369,711 votes cast in this election

* County Vote Totals
   * Jefferson: 10.5% or 38,855 total votes
   * Denver: 82.8% or 306,055 total votes
   * Arapahoe: 6.7% or 24,801 total votes

* Denver County received the highest amount of votes

* Voter Results
	* Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes or 23.0% of the total
	* Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes or 73.8% of the total
	* Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes or 3.1% of the total

* Diana DeGette won this election by receiving 272,892 votes which equated to 73.8% of the total

### Election-Audit Summary
  * Our script can be used for any future state elections throughout the US.
  * In the future if we received additional data such as a voter ethnicty field we could alter the script to output the percentage of candidate votes by voter ethnicty.  
  * We could also add a state field to our data set to analyze country elections.
